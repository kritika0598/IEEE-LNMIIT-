Dr. Karmeshu had his education in Physics from University of Delhi, where he scored highest percentage of marks in all Honour’s courses and was awarded Gold Medal. After finishing his M.Sc., he completed his PhD from the same University in the area of Stochastic Modeling of diffusion of Brownian particles. Thereafter in 1976 he proceeded to University of Stuttgart to work with Prof. Haken, founder of Synergetics. He broadened his research interests and started working in the area of stochastic modeling of non-linear problems arising in variety of systems ranging from physical, engineering, to Socio-technical systems.His earlier work on noise in nuclear reactors and diffusion of innovation are well cited and has been included in several books/monographs. He has published over hundred research papers in refereed journals and has edited one book on “Entropy measures, maximum entropy principle and emerging applications” from (Springer-Verlag) and two special issues of JSIR (CSIR Golden jubilee year) on Mathematical modeling of Innovation Diffusion and R and D Management. He has delivered several invited seminars/lectures in India and other countries. He serves on a number of expert committees. Dr. Karmeshu is recipient of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in Mathematical Sciences (1993) and C.M. Jacob Gold Medal, System Society of India (1990). Dr. Karmeshu’s current areas of research interests are performance modeling of Communication Networks and Wireless Systems, Statistical modeling of Ultrasound images, Computational Neuroscience and Stochastic Models of Social Systems.                                </p>

                                <h3>Chalk and Talk on 'Signal Flow in Communication' by Prof V.Sinha</h3>
                                <p>
                                  The concept of Signals and Systems arise in a wide variety, and the areas and techniques associated with these concepts play an important role in diverse areas of Scienceand Technology. But there are a variety of problems and questions that are of importance and need to be solved and answered. What are those questions?
                                  Prof. V. Sinha, founding Director The LNMIIT, Fellow IEEE answered these 'questions' in this valuable talk on 'Signal Flow in Communication'.                                </p>

                                <h3>Photonics for New Generation Fully-Digital Radar and Wireless Communication Systems by Antonella Bogoni</h3>
                                <p>
                                  The speech will introduce the role of photonics for new generation radar and wireless communication systems. Modern techniques for the photonic-assisted RF generation will be detailed to provide extremely stable multicarrier signals up to the millimeter wave band, with an arbitrary amplitude and phase modulation and phase noise independent on the frequency.
                                  At the receiver photonic technologies will be reported for the optical sampling directly at RF and for the down-conversion of multiple heterogeneous RF signals, allowing an increased resolution.
                                  The innovative transceiver features guaranteed by the use of photonics, will be demonstrated for the development of new generation fully digital multiband single and array radar systems working at high frequency (X band and beyond), and for the design of radically new multi-protocol software- defined wideband wireless communication apparatus.
                                  Finally new applications for safety, traffic and environment control and for new mobile broadband services enabled by the photonic-based radar and wireless communication systems respectively will be summarized.                                </p>

                                <h3>Texas Instrument Workshop on embedded system</h3>
                                <p>
                                  LNMIIT IEEE Student Branch is organising a workshop on Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems in collaboration with Texas Instruments from 29th October to 1st November. The workshop started with an Introductory Talk by the Director, University Programs, Texas Instruments, Mr. Sanjay Srivastava, on 28th October.

                                  The Talk provided the students with an insight of what they were going to learn during the period of the workshop. Students from all years participated enthusiastically.

                                  The event began by honoring the guests with bouquets. Then Prof Raghuvir Tomar gave a brief introduction about the speaker followed by the talk by Mr. Sanjay Srivastava. The question answer round saw lots of keen researchers clearing their doubts regarding this field and the workshop.

                                  In the end, Dr. S.S. Gokhle (Director, LNMIIT) gave his vote of thanks to the honorable guests.
